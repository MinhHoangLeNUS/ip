/**
 * One thing the user has asked Aster to do.
 *
 * <p>A command is built by the {@link Parser} and later carried out by
 * {@link #execute}. What the parser can check depends on the command: for a todo,
 * deadline, event or list it has already checked the wording, while a command that
 * names a task by number carries that text unchecked and settles it when it runs.
 * See {@link IndexedCommand} for why those checks are held back.
 *
 * <p>A command that changes the task list asks for it to be saved after the change has
 * been made and reported. Checks that refuse a command run before anything is changed,
 * so a refused command neither changes the list nor writes to the file. Saving itself
 * can still fail afterwards; when it does, the change stays in this session only and
 * the user is told so.
