/**
 * Reads tasks from, and writes tasks to, a plain text file on disk.
 *
 * <p>Each task is one line, in the order the tasks are held. A line is a type tag,
 * a done flag and then the fields that type needs, separated by {@code " | "}, for
 * example {@code D | 0 | return book | 2019-06-06}. Both halves of that format live in
 * this one class, so the way a task is written and the way it is read back cannot
 * drift apart.
 *
 * <p>A description may itself contain the separator, so every field is escaped when
 * written: a backslash is written as two backslashes, and a separator is written as a
 * backslash followed by the separator. Reading undoes exactly that, which means any
 * text the user can type survives a save and a load unchanged.
 *
 * <p>A blank line carries no task and is not part of the format, so the reader passes
 * over one wherever it appears. Every other line must be a complete record.
 *
 * <p>Dates are stored in the ISO form {@code yyyy-MM-dd}, which is numeric and names
 * no month, so a file written on one computer reads the same on any other whatever
 * each is configured to.
